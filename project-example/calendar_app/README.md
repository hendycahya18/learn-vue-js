## Single-file components - Calendar App

1. Ensure you have `npm` installed.

2. Install the dependencies

```
npm install
```

3. Boot the app

```
npm run serve
```

The server is now running - watch the console output for instructions, but by default, your server is now running (with hot reload) at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)


## Methodology Review
1. Build a static version of the app
2. Break the app into components
3. Hard-code initial states with parent-child data flow
4. Create state actions (and corresponding component dispatchers)
